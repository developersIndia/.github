# Becoming a community moderator

## Responsibilities

1. As an active community moderator, you need to make sure that the folks inside community follow the rules as enforced inside each channel, this involves checking that no-one violates the [developersIndia Code of Conduct](https://github.com/developersIndia/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. Participate in community team meetings, provide feedback on how & what the community can do to improve the experience.
3. Participate & encourage folks inside the community to participate in any community events or software projects.

## Moderator Code of Conduct

- Follow Reddit's [Moderator Code of Conduct](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-code-of-conduct)
- Below is a set of guidelines that is expected to be followed by each community moderator of **developersIndia**.

### Be curious and have a growth mindset

1. You seek new and different perspectives to expand your views.
2. You view feedback as an opportunity to learn.
3. You take decisions deliberately with clarity of purpose.
4. You seek and are open to candid feedback from fellow community moderators without getting defensive.

### Use your judgement efficiently

1. You make decisions using your judgement with community's best interest in mind.
2. When faced with ambiguity, instead of not making a decision, you make a provisional, common sense decision and then 
   - communicate your decision across to other folks in moderator team.
   - seek information from others that can disprove your decision (in case of incorrect decision).

### Don't be a jerk

1. You don't interrupt others, or ignore their opinions.
2. You don't bully, humiliate, or oppress individuals inside the community.
3. You don't use intimidation as a tactic - physical, vocal, or any other kind.
4. You don't attack people personally while giving feedback.
5. You treat people with respect regardless of their disagreements or differences with you.

## Collaboration & Work Styles

This section highlights how the mod & admins can work together with each other in harmony and build a trust among each other. We highly recommend reading this.

- In case of any disputes among mods or between mods & admins. The final decision is taken by community admins.
- We don't want (or expect) you to work `24x7`, being a moderator & community builder is a thankless job. So if you choose to be one, know the consequences in & out. Nevertheless, we (community admins) greatly appreciate your work ‚ô•Ô∏è .
- To build a mutual understanding with each other, we recommend talking with each other over an **audio** call (either on google meet, discord VC etc). If you are uncomfortable with hopping over a call. Building trust over a huge distance over "text" chat doesn't work and has never worked. To fix this we need to be able to talk with you to understand why you want to be a community moderator & what motivates you to stick with the community.
- We expect you to take ownership of things you suggest, instead of pinging other members you should be able to execute decisions you suggest. In case of permission issues ping admin team.
- You are always free to provide feedback to other members on how they work but make sure that no-one gets hurts in this process, i.e instead of criticising people give them a possible solution or a way to improve. In case of disputes, try to avoid arguing over internet. Always know there is a real person on the other side of screen. (Note: this can be prevented if everyone trusts each other).
- You are free to leave the team at any point of time, just ping a admin and we will relieve you of your duties. As soon as you leave, you are not entitled to talk on behalf of the community team.
- You are free to take long breaks as you need (please try to prevent burnout), just let the other team members know that you will not be available for sometime.

If you don't agree with any one point in this list, we recommend you to NOT join the mod team. If you have some follow up questions on some item, feel free to ping the admin team or a representative of the team.
