# developersIndia Community Support

## Finding Support

Almost all projects maintained by the [developersIndia GitHub Org](https://github.com/developersIndia) are community maintained. So, if you need help for using a specific project or want to start contributing to it, feel free to discuss about it. Our [developersIndia subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia) is open to all & join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/b4YYdyYBGH) for closed community banter.

If you found a bug in any of the community maintained projects under the developersIndia banner, please report it to the respective project repository by either opening a Issue/Discussion thread. Be sure to read the [Security Policy](https://github.com/developersIndia/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md) before reporting the security concerns.

Or if you would like to contribute to any of the community maintained projects under the developersIndia banner, please refer to the [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/developersIndia/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR or a feature request.

## Supported Versions

Most if not all projects maintained under the developersIndia banner will follow some sort of version system (like [semver](https://semver.org/)) which will be duly noted in the documentations of all respective projects. Versioning projects under a specific standard helps not only the user but the maintainer of the projects to triage & fix bugs/issues in that specific version of the software.

As such, please ensure to enter every detail of the issues/bug you're facing with the version details when opening or discussing in Issue/Discussion threads.

## Supported Platforms

If you're a project maintainer under the developersIndia community banner, please ensure your project's documentation lists the "_supported platforms_" in the docs properly. And if you're a user of the project, please refer to the respective repository's "_supported sections_" for more info.

If you feel a project is missing support for a specific platform, please reach out to the project maintainer for further notice & assisstance.
