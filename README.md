Hello India, we are finally live at [developersIndia.in](https://developersindia.in). Yes you guessed right, 
the home to India's largest developer community with more than 7000 developers, engineers, programmers, hackers and software people in India.

Since our inception in Jan 2020 through our subreddit, [r/developersindia](https://reddit.com/r/developersindia) we got immense love and support from the software community in India. We couldn't hold ourself back and created a [Discord](https://discord.gg/MKXMSNC) as well to communicate freely with everyone (currently at 2000+ members). We saw a spike of developers coming in our discord that's when we envisioned the idea of developersIndia.in

## Who we are

From experienced professionals to new high-schoolers we are home to every developer in India or so as our subreddit says, _A wholesome community made by and for Indian developers_

### Not just any other developer community

Over the years a lot of user groups have emerged belonging to different tech like Python, Linux etc. This is great but we lacked the most basic thing of building a open-free community to talk, ask questions. That's why we exist, that's what we strive for
How we have helped developers in India you ask?

- by communicating, helping each other
- subreddit already reached and helped a lot of people

## Our goals ?

Just to make sure what we are doing right now and what we plan to do in future, here's a list of our goals:

- Bring together developers in India & uplift the scenario of tech workers in our country.
- Make a strong and powerful culture of free and open-source software.
- Help and nurture next generation of programmers.
- Connect different communities & user groups span India. This includes collaboration with literllay every small separate communities.
