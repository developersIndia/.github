## Who we are

Home to India's largest developer community with more than 15000 developers, engineers, programmers, hackers and software peeps in India.
From experienced professionals to new high-schoolers we are home to every developer in India or so as our subreddit says, _A wholesome community made by and for Indian developers_

### Not just any other developer community

Over the years a lot of user groups have emerged belonging to different tech like Python, Linux etc. This is great but we lacked the most basic thing of building a open-free community to talk, ask questions. That's why we exist, that's what we strive for
How we have helped developers in India you ask?

- by communicating, helping each other
- subreddit already reached and helped a lot of people

## Our goals ?

Just to make sure what we are doing right now and what we plan to do in future, here's a list of our goals:

- Bring together developers in India & uplift the scenario of tech workers in our country.
- Make a strong and powerful culture of free and open-source software.
- Help and nurture next generation of programmers.
- Provide Opportunities and Mentorship
