Home to India's largest developer community network with over `300k` developers, engineers, programmers, hackers, and people who are generally interested in learning more about tech in India. From experienced professionals to new high-school students, we are home to every kind of "_developer_" in India. And that's why even the motto of our subreddit:

> _**A wholesome community made by & for software & tech folks in India. Have a doubt? Ask it out.**_

Over the years a lot of user groups have emerged belonging to different tech communities for Python, Linux, etc. but there was a lack of India-centric software development community.

On top of that, India is a country with a huge population & more often than not, the suggestions & opinions available on other online communities like HackerNews do not apply to Indian software folks. Hence, we strive towards providing that exact opportunity to those who need a platform to either share or gain some knowledge particular to the Indian software scene.
