Home to India's largest developer community network with over `55k` developers, engineers, programmers, hackers and people who're generally interested to learn more about tech in India. From experienced professionals to new high-school students, we are home to every kind of "_developer_" in India. And that's why even the motto of our subreddit is stated as;

> _**A wholesome community made by & for software & tech folks in India. Have a doubt? Ask it out.**_

Over the years a lot of user groups have emerged belonging to different tech communities for Python, Linux etc but there was a lack of India-centric software development community.

On top of that, India is a country of a huge population & more often than not, the suggestions & opinions available on other online communities like HackerNews do not apply to Indian software folks. Hence, we strive towards providing that exact opportunity to those who need a platform to either share or gain some knowledge particular to the Indian software scene.

## üéØ Our Goals

The following is a list of goals & achievements we hope to accomplish through our community efforts:

- Bring together developers in India & uplift the scenario of tech workers in our country.
- Educate & attempt to develop a strong & powerful culture of free and open-source software (FOSS) scene in the country.
- Help and nurture the next generation of Indian programmers.
- Provide networking opportunities & mentorship programmes to those who it need it the most.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Become a Part of the Community

<!-- Update this section as & when necessary -->
Our community is open to everyone across the world of any ethnicity & colour. We don't close our door to any non-Indias but be wary of the fact that the community discussions and/or projects will be very India-centric. As such, here's how you can become a part of the community as well:

1. Join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/MKXMSNC) and/or the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/developersIndia) to answer/discuss among other Indian software devs.
2. Find FOSS projects created by fellow Indians for the community so that members can contribute to it.
3. Share your project with us to be marketed under the developersIndia banner for better reach & PR.

**NOTE**: The aforementioned points aren't set in stone & if you believe you can contribute to the community in one way or the other, feel free to do so!
